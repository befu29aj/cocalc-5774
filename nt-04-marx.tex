  \frametitle{Some Terms}
  \begin{description}
  \item[dialectical materialism] materialism: explanation in terms of
    material things (not ideas) -- the explanatory primacy of economic
    production; dialectic: explanation always depends on history (note
    Engels' ``doubt as to the eternal validity of that which exists'')
  \item[realism] contrasted with dramatizations, idealizations, class
    distortions (Engels insists that realism is sufficient and
    pedagogy unnecessary); Manifesto: ``man is at last compelled to
    face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his
    relations with his kind'' (2)
  \item[bourgeoisie] the class between the aristocracy and the
    proletariat
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Commodity Fetishism}
  In Marxism, \alert{reification} is a process by which objects (such
  as commodities) turn into subjects and subjects (such as people)
  turn into objects (means of production). What once was an object
  becomes by reification active and determining, while the subject
  becomes passive and determined. My namesake Gy{\"o}rgy Luk{\'a}cs
  says in \emph{History and Class Consciousness}
  \begin{quote}
    Just as the capitalist system continuously produces and reproduces
    itself economically on higher levels, the structure of reification
    progressively sinks more deeply, more fatefully, and more
    definitively into the consciousness of man.
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Commodity Fetishism}
  Reification may be the consequence of a simple fallacy:
  \alert{hypostatization}, where an abstraction is treated as if it
  were concrete. For example, you may for a moment mistake the map for
  the territory it represents. Reification leads to
  \alert{alienation}, for example the alienation of the worker from
  production.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What the Bourgeoisie Has Accomplished}
The bourgeoisie has
  \begin{itemize}
  \item resolved personal worth into exchange value
  \item reduced the family relation to a mere money relation
  \item made itself dependent on permanent revolution
  \item rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy
    of rural life
  \item agglomerated production and concentrated property in a few
    hands
  \item has undermined itself by creating the proletariat (``what the
    bourgeoisie produces is its own grave-diggers'')
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Eternal Truths}
  \begin{quote}
    Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and
    all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis. (10)
  \end{quote}
  \begin{quote}
    Law, morality, religion, are to [the proletarian] so many
    bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many
    bourgeois interests. (6)
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Fable of the Bees}
  Here is an interesting precursor to Marxian and Nietzschean ideas
  about morality: Bernard Mandeville's \emph{The Fable of the Bees}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item virtue and morality have as their primary function to
    lubricate the economy (Mandeville therefore insists that they are
    necessary)
  \item vice and immorality are also necessary for the economy, for
    example in inducing us to more spending and consumption
  \end{itemize}
  Rather than being opposed to each other, virtue and vice are
  carefully balanced and conditioned on each other by the requirements
  of a functioning economy.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  The aim of communists is
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the formation of the proletariat into a class
  \item the overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy
  \item the conquest of political power by the proletariat
  \item the use of accumulated labour to widen, to enrich, and to
    promote the existence of the labourer
  \end{itemize}
  The abolition of existing property relations is a consequence of the
  historical process, not unusual in other epochs, and not an explicit
  goal of communists. Communists seek to abolish private property,
  i.e.\ bourgeois property (just as the bourgeois French revolution
  sought to expropriate feudal property). 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  Just as for Nietzsche, morality and its metaphysical manifestations
  (freedom, law, responsibility) is based on a historical
  psychological development; it based on a historical economic
  development in the Communist Manifesto:
  \begin{quote}
    the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law,
    etc. {\ldots} are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your
    bourgeois production and bourgeois property
  \end{quote}
  Aristocrats in their reactionary and charitable support for the
  cause of the proletariat (having the bourgeoisie as a common enemy)
  stoop to ``barter truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool,
  beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.''
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  \begin{block}{consciousness and material existence}
    man's ideas, views, and conceptions, in one word man's
    consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his
    material existence, in his social relations and in his social life
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{School}
  \begin{quote}
And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by social
conditions under which you educate, by the intervention, direct or
indirect, of society, by means of schools? (9)
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Family}
  \begin{quote}
    The bourgeois claptrap about the family and education, about the
    hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the more
    disgusting, the more, by the action of modern industry, all family
    ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children
    transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of
    labour. (9)
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abolition}
  Marx and Engels address the following fears of the bourgeoisie with
  respect to communism.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item abolition of property $\longrightarrow$ abolition of private
    (bourgeois) property
  \item abolition of monogamy $\longrightarrow$ abolition of public
    and private prostitution
  \item abolition of home education $\longrightarrow$ abolition of
    bourgeois social intervention in education
  \item abolition of countries $\longrightarrow$ bourgeoisie and
    proletariat both abolish nationalism, the proletariat will do so
    achieving peace
  \item abolition of eternal truths $\longrightarrow$ class
    antagonisms have indeed been a permanent feature of social
    relations, the communist revolution promises the most radical
    rupture
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  Here is the Communist Manifesto's political action plan:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item raise the proletariat to the position of ruling as to win the
    battle of democracy (contra Lenin)
  \item use the proletariat's political supremacy to wrest, by degrees
    (!), all capital from the bourgeoisie (this cannot be effected
    except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property)
  \item centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the
    State, i.e.\ of the proletariat organized as the ruling class
  \item increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Communist Decalogue}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Abolition of landed property
  \item A heavy progressive income tax
  \item Abolition of rights of inheritance
  \item Confiscation of rebel/emigrant property
  \item Centralization of credit in the hands of the State
  \item Centralization of communication/transport in the hands of the
    State
  \item Extension of State production
  \item Equal liability of all to labour (establishment of industrial
    armies)
  \item Combination of agriculture with manufacturing, more equable
    distribution of population
  \item Free education (abolish children's factory labour, but combine
    education with industrial production)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  In the last two paragraphs of Section II, Marx and Engels predict
  that class distinctions will dissolve, ``public power will lose its
  political character,'' and ``the free development of each is the
  condition for the free development of all.'' This prediction
  strongly clashes with the descriptive projects of Nietzsche and
  Foucault (and certainly with Nietzsche's normative ideas about power
  differentials).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Communist Manifesto}
  Marx and Engels reject other communist/socialist literature mainly
  on a Nietzschean basis: those other communists/socialists seek to
  improve the lot of every class, not just the lot of the proletariat.
  Sometimes they do so (perhaps subconsciously) in order to further
  the ends of their own class (``the old feudal coat of arms on their
  hindquarters'').
  \begin{description}
  \item[reactionary socialism] the feudal aristocracy using the
    proletariat in its resentment against the bourgeoisie
  \item[petty bourgeois socialism] Bernie Sanders type socialism
  \item[German socialism] ``not the interests of the proletariat, but
    the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to
    no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of
    philosophical fantasy'' (compare Taylor's critique of
    existentialism)
  \item[bourgeois socialism] they wish for a bourgeoisie without
    proletariat (and got it in the developed world, didn't they?)
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{A Trump Prophecy in the Manifesto}
  \begin{quote}
    They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of
    production, but against the instruments of production themselves;
    they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they
    smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to
    restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle
    Ages. (5)
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Themes from Manifesto of the Communist Party}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> freedom vs. free trade; ``in bourgeois society capital is
    independent and has individuality, while the living person is
    dependent and has no individuality'' (8); ``the free development
    of each is the condition for the free development of all'' (11)
  \item<2-> the bourgeoisie is self-undermining (4) because it depends
    on unlimited growth
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Dialectical History}
  According to Nancy Love, Marx and Nietzsche have in common that they
  dissolve traditional dichotomies:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item between nature and history
  \item between objective reality and subjective preference (the
    impossibility of the detached observer)
  \item between morality and power; or justice and interest
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Dialectical History}
  Marx and Nietzsche's historical methods are \alert{historical
    materialism} and \alert{genealogy}, respectively. Here is what
  they are not, according to Love:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item transcendent or immanent teleologies
  \item economic or physiological determinisms
  \item incoherent histories
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Dialectical History}
  Both Nietzsche and Marx, as philosophers, lived in the shadow of the
  idealist philosopher GWF Hegel. They were significantly influenced
  by him and defined themselves in contrast to him. Hegel viewed
  history as the autogenesis of spirit. Nietzsche and Marx reject
  teleology (making the consequent the antecedent) in favour of causal
  explanation.
  \begin{block}{Nancy Love: Dialectical History}
    Nonetheless, Nietzsche's overman and Marx's communist society are
    often regarded as immanent historical goals. (73)
  \end{block}
  Nietzsche and Marx would counter that making speculative predictions
  does not turn the consequent into an antecedent. It is always an
  interesting question to what extent a philosopher's descriptive
  project is related to a normative theory.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Dialectical History}
  What is especially problematic about teleology for Nietzsche and
  Marx is that it presupposes that consciousness forms history, when
  precisely the opposite is true. Consciousness is derivative, not
  determinant.

  \bigskip

  Nietzsche and Marx resist determinism in so far as they would always
  explain history as a confluence of a multitude of factors. Foucault
  and Althusser, respectively, bring their opposition to determinism
  into greater relief
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Strategic Interpretation}
  In ``Ressentiment, Value, and Self-Vindication,'' R. Jay Wallace proposes an alternative account to the
  \alert{strategic interpretation}. Here are the problems with the
  strategic interpretation.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The strategic interpretation presupposes that ressentiment
    leads to a table of new values which will injure the interests of
    the oppressors. Yet if the new values were created
    \alert{instrumentally} they cannot serve \alert{intrinsically} as
    a framework for preference, deliberation, and criticism (114).
  \item Even if the strategic features remain below the level of
    consciousness, it is not clear how instrumental rationality could
    arrive at a successful formula that leads from the creation of the
    new values to the injury for the oppressors.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Expressive Interpretation}
  \begin{block}{R. Jay Wallace: Ressentiment, Value, and
      Self-Vindication}
    The ur-context of ressentiment is one in which some people have
    things that you very much desire, but that you lack and feel
    yourself unable ever to obtain. (116)
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item status
  \item material possessions
  \item political power
  \end{itemize}
  RJW does not mention sex and cultural visibility. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Expressive Interpretation}
  What element is added to envy to result in ressentiment? RJW
  considers systematic barriers to the achievement of the desired
  goods (117). Janaway's perspective may be helpful here: envy plus
  the desire to injure may result in ressentiment, whether or not
  there are systematic barriers.

  \bigskip

  On page 128, RJW appears to be in greater agreement with Janaway in
  so far as ressentiment (in contrast to resentment and envy) is
  primitive and lacks more fundamental value judgments (and can
  therefore lead to new values without undermining itself).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Expressive Interpretation}
  \begin{block}{R. Jay Wallace: Ressentiment, Value, and
      Self-Vindication}
    The fundamental emotional dynamic of the slave revolt is not the
    selection of means to an end that is set by one's desires. It is
    the expression of one's negative emotional orientation toward the
    powerful, in the embrace of an evaluative framework that makes
    sense of that basic orientation. (118)
  \end{block}
  Question: do the powerless really have negative emotions towards
  their oppressors? Do they not rather admire them? Emulate them (see
  127f for RJW's response)? Is it not rather the powerless who against
  their own interests subscribe to the values of the powerful? Do they
  not rather direct their frustration at their plight against
  themselves (Janaway)?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Vindication}
  In Janaway, there is cognitive dissonance in the agent who inflicts
  punishment on herself: why is she hurting herself? This dissonance
  is resolved by a migrated concept from debtor-creditor
  relationships (rather than the more accurate explanation of a
  frustrated will to power).

  \bigskip

  In RJW, there is another cognitive dissonance. The powerless person
  asks herself: why do I hate those that are ``good'' (the powerful)?
  The dissonance is resolved by inverting the evaluative spectrum: the
  good (aristocrats) are evil, the bad (powerless) are good. This
  inversion vindicates the pent-up hatred that the powerless focus on
  the powerful.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cui Bono?}
  In RJW's Nietzsche interpretation, the aristocrats eventually
  assimilate the values of the slave revolt based on the sheer number
  of people who have internalized those values. I have an alternative
  proposal: see next slide.

  \bigskip

  The more relevant question is why does the aristocracy care so much
  about the powerless, not why the powerless hate the aristocracy so
  much. The answer, I suspect, is found in the interests of the
  powerful. Thus, the economic advantage of the wealthy is aligned
  with the implementation of Christian charity. Furthermore, there is
  no Wallace Vindication needed for slaves with respect to the new
  values of the slave revolt---because those also were imposed on them
  by the aristocracy (this is more of a Marxian than a Nietzschean
  viewpoint). 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cui Bono?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The powerful accepted the values of the slave revolt because
    these values ultimately promote the goals \emph{of the powerful}.
    Political and cultural liberalism has succeeded more effectively
    at creating a superior class than uncouth conservativism (treating
    the poor as objects of disdain rather than charity), which has
    never been able to harness the productive powers of the oppressed.
\item It is the invention of the ``middle class'' that has given
  almost unlimited potential of wealth and power accumulation to the
  currently ruling aristocracy.
\item The question is whether the aristocracy was able to pull off
  this stunt of making themselves loved and served by the masses as a
  result of strategy or the convolutions of historical contingency.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
