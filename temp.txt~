All instincts which are not discharged outwardly turn inwards---this is what I call the internalization of man: with it there now evolves in man what will later be called his soul. The whole inner world, originally stretched thinly as though between two layers of skin, was expanded and extended itself and gained depth, breadth and height in proportion to the degree that the external discharge of man's instincts was obstructed. Those terrible bulwarks with which state organizations protected themselves against the old instincts of freedom---punishments are a primary instance of this kind of bulkwark---had the result that all those instincts of the wild, free, roving man were turned backwards, against man himself. Animosity, cruelty, the pleasure of pursuing, raiding, changing and destroying---all this was pitted against the person who had such instincts: that is the origin of bad conscience. Lacking external enemies and obstacles, and forced into the oppressive narrowness and conformity of custom, man impatiently ripped himself apart, persecuted himself, gnawed at himself, gave himself no peace and abused himself, this animal who battered himself raw on the bars of his cage and who is supposed to be tamed; man, full of emptiness and torn apart with homesickness for the desert, has had to create from within himself an adventure, a torture-chamber, an unsafe and hazardous wilderness---this fool, this prisoner consumed with longing and despair, became the inventor of bad conscience. With it, however, the worst and most insidious illness was introduced, one from which mankind has not yet recovered; man's sickness of man, of himself: as the result of a forcible breach with his animal past, a simultaneous leap and fall into new situations and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against all the old instincts on which, up till then, his strength, pleasure and formidableness had been based.

M-Naturalism [methodological naturalism] requires the philosopher seeking to understand human beliefs, attitudes and behaviour to develop a speculative psychology of human beings and human nature. This aligns Nietszche quite closely with Hume, as many scholars have now noted, though Hume had only Newtonian science as a paradigm, while Nietzsche had the benefit of extensive familiarity with developments in 19th-century science on which to draw, both substantively and speculatively.
