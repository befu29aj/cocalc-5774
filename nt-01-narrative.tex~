Which of the following features is not one that Galen Strawson
investigates as a possible condition for diachronicity?

\begin{block}{iClicker Question}
Who is Strawson's example of someone who thinks that the psychological
narrativity thesis is true (ordinary human beings experience their
lives in some sort of narrative way), but the ethical narrativity
thesis is NOT true (the narrative outlook is not essential to a
well-lived life)?
\end{block}

\item[A\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] Henry James
\item[B\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] Jean-Paul Sartre

  \frametitle{Two Claims}
  \begin{description}
  \item[psychological thesis] this is a descriptive, empirical claim
    about the nature of ordinary human experience, where a lack of
    narrativity is pathological with respect to how ordinary that
    experience is
  \item[ethical thesis] this is a normative, ethical claim that a
    narrative outlook is essential to a well-lived life, to true or
    full personhood

  \frametitle{Relevant Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What are persistence conditions?
  \item What is the difference between a human being and a subjectively
    experienced self?
  \item What is true about these intuitions: the chilling, empty
    deficiency of the Episodic life versus the macerated, clogged,
    excessively self-concerned, inauthentically second-order qualities
    of the Diachronic life?
  \item Does it make a difference to be explicitly or implicitly
    narrativizing?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Episodic Life}
  \begin{block}{Against Narrativity, page 433}
    I have absolutely no sense of my life as a narrative with form, or
    indeed as a narrative without form. Absolutely none. Nor do I have
    any great or special interest in my past. Nor do I have a great
    deal of concern for my future.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{More Relevant Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How is it that the from-the-inside quality of a memory can be
    detached from any sense that one is the subject of the remembered
    experience (434)?
  \item Does Strawson give a satisfying answer to what it is to have
    or be a self? Is there an abolition of selfhood lurking in the
    background? Who am I, and if so, how many? (Richard David Precht)
    See also \emph{The Ego Tunnel} by Thomas Metzinger or \emph{The
      Architecture of the Mind} by Peter Carruthers. What are the
    metaphysics of selfhood?
  \item How do you assess Strawson's argument that the ethical
    narrativity claim is associated with self-importance, religion,
    and narcissism (436f)?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{More Relevant Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Does the making coffee narrative scale up to larger narratives
    and propagate to higher levels; or is Strawson correct to call the
    narrativity claim about short-term plans trivial?
  \item Has Strawson addressed the problem that narrativists have with
    an invasive scientific anthopology? (See footnote 27.)
  \item How can a narrative be defined stringently? Note Strawson's
    emphasis on developmental, temporal unity and coherence.
  \item What does a personal relationship with an Episodic look like?
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Jacques Derrida I}
  \begin{quote}
    I understand that the question of the marriage vows was, this
    morning, considered interesting by some of you, the ``yes'' to the
    marriage, the performative ``yes'' -- ``I do'', ``I do''. This
    ``yes'' has to be repeated differently each time. If it's simply a
    record saying ``I do'' ``I do'' ``I do'' there is no fidelity. For
    this ``I do'' to be a renewed promise it has to be different each
    time, the same one and different. In order to follow the ``I do''
    today (before the priest), the ``idea'' of tomorrow should be the
    same and different {\ldots}

  \frametitle{Jacques Derrida II}
  \begin{quote}
    {\ldots} They must follow one another and confirm themselves but,
    at the same time, be different. That's what the counter-signature
    is. Of course, even if I say to the same person ``I do'' tomorrow
    and after tomorrow, the fact that this ``I do'' is different, to
    some extent, means at the same time fidelity and betrayal. Indeed,
    it's a kind of perjury to say ``I do'' to someone. So that may be
    the paradox in the twin concepts of acoluthia and anacoluthon. You
    have to betray in order to be truthful. (Life After Theory, 10f)

  \frametitle{Conditions of Narrativity}
  \begin{description}
  \item[diachronicity] I identify myself (the one who is the receiver
    of my subjective experiences) with the human being that I was in
    the past and that I will be in the future
  \item[form-finding] I seek for coherence, unity, and pattern in the
    temporal sequence events in my life
  \item[story-telling] I think of my life in recognizable literary
    genres
  \item[revision] I distort facts about my life so that they fit the
    kind of story that I want to tell about myself (444)
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Strawson's Shift}
  There is a marked shift on page 447 to a negative evaluation of
  narrativity. There appears to be some inconsistency between the
  pre-447 Strawson and the post-447 Strawson.
